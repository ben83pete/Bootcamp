Before I started this bootcamp, I worked for Eurest. My job title was Meeting Services. 
Each day it was my responsibilty to prep 19 different conference rooms for the day.  This included 
rearranging the tables to which ever configuration was needed, checkingall the AV equipment and assesing 
the room for cleanliness.

The reason I am taking this Bootcamp is I want to get into a new career.  I have had many 'Jobs'
in my life, but none that I could see myself staying with for any long amount of time.   When I 
learned about this bootcamp, I knew it was the quickest/best way to change into a new career.

After this bootcamp is over, I would like to get a job in a field creating new software.
