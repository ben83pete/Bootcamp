Before I started this bootcamp, I worked for Eurest. My job title was Meeting Services. 
Each day it was my responsibilty to prep 19 different conference rooms for the day.  This included 
rearranging the tables to the required configuration, checking the AV equipment and assessing 
the room for cleanliness.

The reason I am taking this Bootcamp is I want to get into a new career.  I have had many jobs
in my life, but none that I could see myself staying with for any long time.   When I 
learned about this bootcamp, I knew it was a great opportunity for a career change.

After this bootcamp is over, I would like to get a job in a field creating new software.  
One of the biggest goals for myself is to have a career that I can continue until I retire.
